### Escape characters

|      |                 |
| ---- | --------------- |
| `\t` | tab             |
| `\'` | `'`             |
| `\"` | `"`             |
| `\r` | carriage return |
| `\\` | `\`             |
| `\n` | new line        |
| `\f` | form feed       |
| `\b` | back space      |

`k#` also supports unicode escape characters `\uxxxx` that represent a hexadecimal value from `\u0000` to `\uFFFF`

## Numbers

### Integers

```haskell
1  100 -50
```

### Decimals

```haskell
1.5 0.4 .3 -45.0 1e10
```

### Thousands separator

`k#` allows to use `_` as thousand separator

```fsharp
1_000_000
```

### Expressing numbers in different bases

1. binary

```fsharp
0b1001_0001
```

2. hexadecimal

```fsharp
0xFF00FF
```

3. Octal

```fsharp
0o1236
```

## Collections

### Lists

```haskell
[1, 2, 3]
```

### Maps

```javascript
{"key": value, "key": value}
```

### Set

```fsharp
#[1, 2, 4, 5]
```

### Tuples

They are expressions followed by `,`

```fsharp
1, 2
```

With `list` and `sets` you must surround the tuple with parenthesis

```fsharp
[(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```
