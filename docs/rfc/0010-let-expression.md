# Let expression

Let expressions allow define variables and one expression at the end with access to all the variables defined

```haskell
let x = 10
    y = 20
then x + 10
```

you can nest many let expressions

```haskell
let x = let x1 = 10
            x2 = 20
        then x1 + x2
    y = 30
then x + y
```
